# GenAI_LLM_RAG_Tutoring_System

Welcome to the **GenAI_LLM_RAG_Tutoring_System** project, part of our *Learn RAG from Scratch* series! This intelligent tutoring system leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create an adaptive learning experience. By combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and RAG, we aim to provide real-time feedback and personalized learning pathways for learners.

## ðŸš€ About the Project

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a cutting-edge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application. Using powerful tools like **LangChain**, **ChromaDB**, and **HuggingFace Transformers**, we'll create a system capable of retrieving relevant document chunks and generating context-aware answers. 

This project demonstrates the power of RAG systems in creating AI-driven educational tools, specifically tailored to provide personalized feedback to learners.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Learn:

- **Preprocessing and Vectorizing Documents** with LangChain
- **Efficient Similarity Searches** using ChromaDB
- **Integrating Embeddings and Retrieval** into the workflow
- **Generating Accurate, Context-Aware Answers** using LLMs
- **Building an Interactive UI** with Streamlit

## ðŸ’¡ Technologies Used:

- **LangChain** â€“ For document preprocessing and chaining models
- **ChromaDB** â€“ To perform efficient similarity searches and store embeddings
- **HuggingFace Transformers** â€“ To leverage state-of-the-art LLMs for generating context-aware responses
- **Streamlit** â€“ To build an interactive user interface for the tutoring system

## ðŸ’» Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.7+
- Install required libraries via `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the System:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd GenAI_LLM_RAG_Tutoring_System
    ```
2. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## ðŸ”¥ Why RAG?

RAG systems enhance the capabilities of LLMs by incorporating external knowledge through retrieval. This enables more accurate, context-aware responses, which is particularly useful for personalized tutoring systems like this one. By combining retrieval and generation, you can adapt learning experiences to each learnerâ€™s needs in real-time.
